# Movie Success Analysis
 

In this project, I created a MySQL database combining a subset of IMDB's and TMDb's data on movies. The objective was to analyze the key drivers of a movie's success and provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

Throughout the project, the following key steps were undertaken:

**Part 1:** Downloaded and filtered IMDB movie data as requested by the stakeholders.

**Part 2:** Leveraged The Movie Database (TMDb)'s open API to extract box office revenue and profit data, enriching the IMDB dataset. This additional information was then used for comprehensive exploratory data analysis.

**Part 3:** Constructed and exported a MySQL database, incorporating the collected data, for efficient storage and retrieval.

**Part 4:** Employed hypothesis testing to delve into the critical factors that influence a movie's success.
