# Prediction of Movie Success

## Inspecting Movie Features to Predict Revenue

This data analysis takes info from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).  Using up-to-date statistical data from US-based movies I determine the features contributing to the revenue-based success of a movie. 

* **Part 1:** Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
* **Part 2:** Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
* **Part 3:** Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
* **Part 4:** Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
* **Part 5 (Optional):** Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.
