# Prediction of Movie Success

## Inspecting Movie Features to Predict Revenue

**Author: Echo Diaz**


My goal is to determine what movie attributes contribute to the success of a movie within the U.S.  Using up-to-date statistical data from IMDB movies, I determine the features contributing to the revenue-based success of a movie. 

This data analysis takes info from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).

For this analysis I've broken down the process of extracting, cleaning, filtering and exploratory data analysis into digestible parts:

* **Part 1:** Download several files from IMDB’s movie data set and filter out the subset of U.S. movies 
* **Part 2:** Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data, add to the IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis
* **Part 3:** Construct and export a MySQL database using the data.
* **Part 4:** Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful
* **Part 5 (Optional):** Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.
