# Movie Success Analysis
 

In this project, I created a MySQL database combining a subset of IMDB's and TMDb's data on movies. The objective was to analyze the key drivers of a movie's success and provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

Throughout the project, the following key steps were undertaken:

**Part 1:** Downloaded and filtered IMDB movie data as requested by the stakeholders.

**Part 2:** Leveraged The Movie Database (TMDb)'s open API to extract box office revenue and profit data, enriching the IMDB dataset. This additional information was then used for comprehensive exploratory data analysis.

**Part 3:** Constructed and exported a MySQL database, incorporating the collected data, for efficient storage and retrieval.

**Part 4:** Employed hypothesis testing to delve into the critical factors that influence a movie's success.


## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

During the exploratory data analysis, a mixture of barplots, boxplots, and histograms were visualized for each datatype column.

The histogram shows the majority of US movies are rated R, followed by PG-13, and PG.

The boxplot reveals that G-rated movies generate the highest revenue, with PG-13 and PG-rated films following closely in revenue rankings. Boxplots depict the range and median of movie genres, with a black bar indicating the distribution. Notably, G-rated movies exhibit a wider revenue range compared to R-rated films.
